<p>The universe is filled with large collections of things.  For example, 18 milliliters of water (just over 1 U.S. tablespoon) contains an Avogadro's number of water molecules.  Theoretically, if we understood the behavior of each water molecule exactly, we could fully characterize the properties of the collection of water molecules.  But of course, that's ridiculous... how could we ever measure the position and momentum of trillions and trillions of molecules instantaneously and with precision?  Perhaps we don't really need to make all those measurements... what if we could predict <em>microscopic</em> behavior from <em>macroscopic</em> observations, and then we could make <em>macroscopic</em> predictions from our predicted <em>microscopic</em> behaviors?</p>

<p>Enter statistical mechanics.  Statistical mechanics provides an extremely powerful toolbox for reasoning mathematically and physically about large collections of things.  It meshes seamlessly with the laws of physics to give us a way to think about these large collections of things.</p>

<h2>Big and Small</h2>

<p>Before we begin, let's define the terms <em>microscopic</em> and <em>macroscopic</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>microscopic</em> behaviors of a system are associated with a system's <em>microstate</em>.  The microstate of a system is a complete characterization of every particle in the system.  For example, the microstate of our 18 milliliter sample of water is a list of the position and momentum of every water molecule in the entire sample.</p>

<p>The <em>macroscopic</em> behaviors of a system are associated with a system's <em>macrostate</em>.  The macrostate of a system is an overall, high-level depiction of a system, in terms of things that we can observe at a high level.  For example, the macrostate of our 18 milliliter sample of water describes its temperature, density, and volume, among other variables.</p>

<p>Importantly, macrostate variables are <em>independent</em> of a system's precise microstate.  Knowing the temperature of a system tells us some information about <em>all</em> of the particles at once (their mean kinetic energy) but no information at all about any <em>particular</em> particle (its individual kinetic energy).</p>

<h2>Counting States</h2>

<p>Let's think about a very simple example to get us warmed up and accustomed to thinking in the terms of statistical mechanics.  Consider a single particle with mass \( m \) in a 3-dimensional cubic box with side length \( L \).  The microstate of this system consists of six variables: the position of the particle \( (x, y, z) \) within the box, and the momentum of the particle in three directions \( (p_x, p_y, p_z) \).  Given these six variables, we can completely characterize the entire system.</p>

<p>What do we know about the macrostate of this system?  One very common macrostate variable is <em>total energy</em>.  How much energy is contained in this system?  Because we only have one particle and its only energy is kinetic, we have</p>

<p>\[ \begin{align*} E &= \frac12 m v^2 \\ &= \frac12 m (v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2) \\ &= \frac12 m (\frac{p_x^2}{m^2} + \frac{p_y^2}{m^2} + \frac{p_z^2}{m^2}) \\ &= \frac{1}{2m} (p_x^2 + p_y^2 + p_z^2) . \end{align*} \]</p>

<p>Another very common macrostate variable is <em>volume</em>.  The volume of a cube with side length \( L \) is</p>

<p>\[ V = L^3 . \]</p>

<p>Our next question is quite unusual, but its answer forms the foundation of all statistical mechanics.  For a given macrostate (energy \( E \) and volume \( V \)), what is the probability that the system is in a specific microstate?</p>

<p>This seems on the surface to be an impossible question to answer.  There are an uncountably infinite number of possible microstates, and therefore each one has zero probability.  So let's rephrase our question... given a specific macrostate, what is the probability <em>density</em> of a specific microstate?</p>

<h2>The Fundamental Postulate</h2>

<p>To answer this question, we will need to understand the <em>fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics</em>.  The fundamental postulate states that, for an isolated system in equilibrium, every possible microstate is equally likely.  We refer to this as a postulate because it does not come from any experimental evidence or rational justification... it simply seems like a good guess, and scientists are pretty confident in it because it leads to reasonable results.</p>

<p>Mathematically, we can express the postulate by thinking of each microstate as a point in a six-dimensional <em>phase space</em>.  Consider a six-dimensional space in which every dimension represents a microscopic variable.  This allows us to represent the X, Y, and Z coordinates and X, Y, and Z momenta independently.  For reasons that will become clear shortly, we'll focus on the range of energies between zero and \( E \).  If we allow energies between zero and \( E \) and we fix the volume at \( V \), there will be constraints on which microstates are <em>accessible</em>.  Considering only the momenta in a three-dimensional space,</p>

<p>\[ \begin{align*} E &= \frac{1}{2m} (p_x^2 + p_y^2 + p_z^2) \\ 2 m E &= p_x^2 + p_y^2 + p_z^2 \end{align*} \]</p>

<p>we see that \( p_x, p_y, p_z \) must lie inside a ball with radius \( \sqrt{2mE} \).  Considering only the positions in a three-dimensional space,</p>

<p>\[ V = L^3 \]</p>

<p>we see that \( x, y, z \) must <em>also</em> lie inside a cube with side length \( L \).  Let's call the accessible region \( S \) and the probability density of a given microstate \( p \).  The fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics tells us that</p>

<p>\[ \int_S p \, dV = p \int_S \, dV . \]</p>

<p>In other words, \( p \) is a constant value across \( S \).  But not just any value... we can actually compute it!  Probability density functions, by their definition, need to integrate to one across all of space.  Because \( p \) is only nonzero inside of \( S \), we can write</p>

<p>\[ \begin{align*} \int_S p \, dV &= p \int_S \, dV = 1 \\ \therefore p &= \frac{1}{\int_S \, dV} \end{align*} . \]</p>

<p>This gives us an explicit expression for the probability density of any given microstate.  So we're almost done?</p>

<h2>Density of States</h2>

<p>Not quite.  We took that integral above over all accessible microstates with energies <em>between</em> zero and \( E \).  We did this so that our result would work out to a six-dimensional volume, which happens to make the mathematics a bit easier.  But that isn't quite what we want, now is it?  What we should have done is measured the accessible microstates with energies of <em>exactly</em> \( E \).  It turns out a good way to approach this is differentiating the volume of \( S \) with respect to \( E \).  Conceptually, taking a derivative takes a measurement of the space between \( E \) and \( E + dE \) as \( dE \) gets extremely small.  Let's define this result as \( \Omega \).</p>

<p>\[ \Omega := \frac{\partial}{\partial E} \int_S \, dV \]</p>

<p>This result is so important that it has a special name in statistical mechanics... the <em>density of states</em> function.  Though it may have a very strange definition, the ability to calculate it will serve us very well, as we'll see shortly.</p>

<h2>Integrate, Integrate, Integrate!</h2>

<p>Let's compute the density of states function \( \Omega \) for our provided particle in a 3-dimensional box.  By the definition of the density of states,</p>

<p>\[ \begin{align*} \Omega &:= \frac{\partial}{\partial E} \int_S \, dV \\ &= \frac{\partial}{\partial E} \int_S \, dp_x \, dp_y \, dp_z \, dx \, dy \, dz \end{align*} \]</p>

<p>Remember when we said that considering the momentum was like integrating over a ball in 3-dimensions?</p>

<p>\[ \Omega = \frac{\partial}{\partial E} \int_S \frac{4}{3} \pi (2mE)^{3/2} \, dx \, dy \, dz \]</p>

<p>We now have an integral only in terms of spatial coordinates.  We recognize this as simply the volume of the box itself.</p>

<p>\[ \Omega = \frac{\partial}{\partial E} \frac{8 \sqrt{2}}{3} \pi (mE)^{3/2} V \]</p>

<p>Last step!  Let's differentiate with respect to total energy.</p>

<p>\[ \Omega = \frac{\partial}{\partial E} 4 \sqrt{2} m^{3/2} \pi V \sqrt{E} \]</p>

<p>Very interesting!  It would seem that, as we add energy to this system, the number of possible states in which it can exist increases with the square root of energy.  The proportionality factors out front will end up not mattering in the near future... what's critical here is that the density of states is proportional to the square root of energy for one particle.</p>

<p>In review, the density of states function is the <em>derivative</em> with respect to <em>total energy</em> of the volume of phase space contained by \( 0 \le \frac{1}{2m} \sum_i p_i^2 \le E \).  That's a lot to think about!  A non-rigorous but perfectly acceptable way to think about the density of states is as a "number" of accessible microstates, even though the density of states doesn't always evaluate to an integer.  In the next lesson, we'll extend our reasoning here to \( N \) particles in a box!</p></body>
