Hello!  First of all... thank you so much for visiting the site!  I'm very grateful that you're here and reading this, because that means that we've reached one more person in our effort to make high-quality and accessible materials for engineering education freely available to everybody.  Welcome... and please explore everything we have to offer!

My name is Joseph, and I'm the primary editor of this site.  I created this website in 2025 during my senior year at MIT.  MIT has made extensive efforts to make its educational materials available to the public free of charge, and I very much consider this an extension of MIT's efforts (though MIT does not directly support or endorse this site in any way).  I initially wanted people with an interest in learning engineering, mathematics, and computer science, and those exploring new frontiers in these fields, to have a place to go to find rigorous explanations of basic mathematical and physical concepts in their fields of interest.

This leads me to our pedagogy.  We believe that rigorous and first-principles reasoning is the basis of all proper scientific inquiry, and, when applied correctly, rigorous scientific inquiry has the immense potential to transform lives for the better.
