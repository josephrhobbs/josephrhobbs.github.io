# Theory of Probability

~

So much in our world is uncertain.  We want to know if it will rain tomorrow, if a medicine will treat an ailment, or if a coin toss will land in our favor.  Scientists and engineers encounter incredible amounts of uncertainty in their work, and they need to be able to quantify and control this uncertainty if their work is to be successful and repeatable.  Probability theory is a branch of applied mathematics that enables scientists and engineers to quantify and understand the uncertainty in the world.
