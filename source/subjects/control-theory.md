# Control Theory

~

Engineering systems are often incredibly complex.  These systems' complexity, subjected to the laws of physics, almost inevitably create difficulties for their designers and users, especially when these systems are not stable in their natural state.  These systems can be stabilized (or their stability can be further improved) through the power of _control theory_, a branch of applied mathematics focused on developing methods for controlling these systems.
