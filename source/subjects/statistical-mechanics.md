# Statistical Mechanics

~

The universe is filled with lots of collections of things.  Sometimes, these collections are so large that it's (nearly) impossible to describe them directly... we can only reason about the behavior of the collective.  _Statistical mechanics_ gives us a mathematical framework to reason about large systems or collections of items.  It's important to note that statistical mechanics is half physics, half mathematics; many of its foundations originate in classical thermodynamics, but its mathematical tools give us the opportunity to reason about much more than just thermodynamcis problems.

The lessons below assume a general familiarity with multivariable calculus and probability theory, though they should remain accessible to anybody comfortable with algebra and spatial reasoning.
