# Blog

~

This site is dedicated to making available to anybody high-quality, accessible, and free materials and resources for engineering education.  This blog is an extension of the educational resources available in [Subjects](subjects), though the topics covered here do not fit nicely into any of those subjects.  Instead, to support the mission of this site, this blog is intended for discussing new and emerging technologies in academia and industry, interdisciplinary or creative approaches to solving problems, and trends in engineering education.

Coming soon!
